## 📖 Project Overview

This portfolio is designed to be a comprehensive showcase of my work as a BCA student and technology enthusiast. It features a clean, minimalist user interface that focuses on typography and whitespace to create a professional reading experience.

The site includes a fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. It also features an advanced dark mode 🌓 that can automatically switch between light and dark themes based on the time of day (7 AM to 7 PM), ensuring a comfortable viewing experience at all times.

## ✨ Key Features

The website is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) 📱, meaning it can be installed as a native application on both mobile and desktop devices. It includes offline support using a Service Worker, allowing users to access the site even without an internet connection.

Accessibility ♿ is a core priority. The site adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring it is friendly to screen readers and fully navigable via keyboard. It also respects user preferences for reduced motion.

For Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 🔍, the site includes comprehensive meta tags for social sharing (Open Graph and Twitter Cards) and structured data (JSON-LD) to ensure rich search results.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

The project is built using standard web technologies:
- HTML5 for semantic structure
- CSS3 with custom properties for styling
- JavaScript (ES6+) for logic and interactivity

It utilizes the `@studio-freight/lenis` library for smooth scrolling and Font Awesome for icons. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 📂 Project Structure

The codebase is organized into clear directories. The `assets` folder contains stylesheets, images, and icons. Secondary pages like the 404 error page and thank you page are located in the `pages` directory. The main logic resides in `script.js`, while the Service Worker logic is in `sw.js`.

## 🚦 Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, clone the repository using Git. Navigate to the project directory and serve it using any static file server, such as Python's `http.server` or the Live Server extension in VS Code.

## 🧪 Testing

The project undergoes rigorous testing to ensure quality. Manual testing is performed across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
